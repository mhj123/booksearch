The Social Self;The Social Self is a multifaceted analysis of the self concept based on the social nature of the self The emphasis is on selfesteem along with selfcentrality selfcomplexity social interest identification power marginality openness and majority identification The book relies on an approach based upon nonverbal measures of the self concept and in which the individual is asked to locate himself in relation to a field of significant others represented in a variety of geometric arrangements using symbols of the self and others  Comprised of nine chapters this book begins with a description of some of the basic components of the self system including selfesteem social interest and marginality The discussion moves toward more complex analyses including the alienation syndrome and the political personality involving two or more of the components of the social self The next section focuses on the development of the self concept and examines such variables as socioeconomic background and the history of geographic mobility of the child A theory of selfother orientation is also considered along with a helical theory of personal change   This monograph is intended for students of social psychology personality sociology and education who are interested in the self concept its measurement and theoretical considerations
Computability Complexity Logic;The theme of this book is formed by a pair of concepts the concept of formal language as carrier of the precise expression of meaning facts and problems and the concept of algorithm or calculus ie a formally operating procedure for the solution of precisely described questions and problemsThe book is a unified introduction to the modern theory of these concepts to the way in which they developed first in mathematical logic and computability theory and later in automata theory and to the theory of formal languages and complexity theory Apart from considering the fundamental themes and classical aspects of these areas the subject matter has been selected to give priority throughout to the new aspects of traditional questions results and methods which have developed from the needs or knowledge of computer science and particularly of complexity theoryIt is both a textbook for introductory courses in the abovementioned disciplines as well as a monograph in which further results of new research are systematically presented and where an attempt is made to make explicit the connections and analogies between a variety of concepts and constructions

Hazardous Substances and Human Health;There is widespread public concern about hazardous chemicals that are contained in air soil water and food Policy has therefore adopted a series of laws and regulations concerning emissions into and concentration levels in different media including food As policy makers do not only have to consider the protection of the environment but also need to ensure a wellfunctioning economy at the same time these limit or target values need to be set in a balanced way The main problem however is to compare the costs for achieving these targets with the benefits to society by having a smaller exposure to hazardous substances costbenefit analysis brbrThis book sets out to improve the reliability of costbenefit analyses particularly of hazardous substances present in air water soil and food It suggests that the human health risk assessment of chemicals is performed in a bottomup analysis ie following a spatially resolved multimedia modelling approach In order to support costbenefit analyses the approach is accompanied by monetary valuation of human health impacts yielding socalled external costs Results for selected priority metals show that these external costs are small compared to those by the classical air pollutants and involve rather long time horizons touching on the aspect of intergenerational equity within sustainable development When including further hazardous substances the total external costs attributable to contaminants are expected to be more substantial
